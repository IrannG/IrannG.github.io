							  	<h3>The Babadook</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/20200522_195305.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<br>	This work was inspired by the film, "The Babadook". I created the piece with separate references of the Babadook
										and creepy rooms. I find the design of the character very simple yet terrifying. I wanted to capture the mistery of
										his actual form by having him blend into the darkness of the closet.<p>

									<h3>Starvation</h3>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/spookyhead.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<br><br>This is one of my original works. After studying the human skull I became familiar with
									it's bone structure and perspective. I wanted to give a slight twist to the bone-only look of the
									bust and desided that drawing only very thin layer of muscle and fat would make a morbid skull.</p>

									<br><br><br><br>
								<h2>Media</h2>
									<p>I mainly specialize with simple graphite mechanical pencils. Not having access to specialized art tools as a child,
									I quickly became comfortable with normal 0.7mm mechanical pencils. Slowly, I started incorporating more useful tools to better my art.
								I began shading with paper stumps and regular tissue paper for more realistic effects. I then started using higher quality erasers and
							mechanical pencils with a much smaller lead size. I am slowly moving on to working with pens, ink, and eventually color. I feel that if I
						master the tools I need to draw and shade in black and white, it will be much easier to adapt to more complex media.</p>

								<h2>My Style</h2>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/scarystories.png" alt="" /></span>
								As a 10 year old child I was fascinated with the popular book series, "Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark".
							I admired the poetry and story telling in the book, but most of all, I was inspired by it's aesthetic.
						The drawings in the book, created by Stephen Gammell, were something I had never seen before. Looking back at them now,
					they were weirdly PG. However, as a child I felt terrified for the first time in my life. I felt that if I looked at the
				drawings for too long they would come to life. This feeling amused me later on in life, and I felt like I wanted to dive
			deeper. I became obsessed with knowing why certain things are terrifying to humans, and how a simple pencil on paper can elicit
		such strong emotions. I have been deeply involved with this topic ever since, and I plan on getting better and better on depicting true terror.  </p>
